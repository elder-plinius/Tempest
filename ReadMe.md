# Tempest

## Description

Tempest is an open-source project that aims to automate the process of turning user ideas into functional GitHub repositories. It leverages the Code Llama 7B model to break down goals and autonomously write the code needed for development.

## Autonomous GitHub Issue Monitoring and Solving

One of the standout features of Tempest is its ability to autonomously monitor and solve GitHub issues. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of the Code Llama 7B model, Tempest can:

- Automatically scan new and existing GitHub issues for actionable tasks.
- Prioritize issues based on predefined criteria.
- Generate and commit code to resolve issues.
- Close issues upon successful code deployment and testing.
- Crowd-sourced BrainTempest: community members can add ideas as they think of them and agents can suggest the most viable to start building.

This feature aims to significantly reduce manual intervention in issue management, thereby streamlining the development process.
